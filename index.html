      <details>
        <summary>1. Tell me about yourself.</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I’m Deep Chandra Joshi, currently working as a Senior Executive at iEnergizer focusing on AI data annotation and quality control. I have a background in frontend development (ReactJS) and enjoy solving problems, optimizing processes, and learning new technologies. I’m detail-oriented, comfortable with repetitive accuracy-focused tasks, and motivated by opportunities that combine technical work with team collaboration.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3. What are your strengths?</summary>
        <div class="answer">

      <details>
        <summary>4. What are your weaknesses?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Earlier I tended to take on too many responsibilities at once. I’ve learned to prioritize using task lists, time blocking, and regular syncs with managers to ensure the highest-impact tasks are completed first. This approach has improved both my delivery and work-life balance.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</summary>

      <details>
        <summary>7. What are your hobbies?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I enjoy coding personal projects (especially ReactJS), watching sci-fi movies, following cricket matches, and listening to music. These activities help me recharge and occasionally inspire small automation or UI ideas I prototype for fun.</p>
        </div>

      <details>
        <summary>8. Are you a team player?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes — I collaborate well across roles, share knowledge willingly, and adapt to team processes. At the same time I’m comfortable working independently to drive tasks to completion and maintain high-quality output.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9. What do you know about our company?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I’ve researched your company’s services, market focus, and recent projects — and I’m impressed by your emphasis on [industry-specific detail]. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to [team/project] and help improve data-driven outcomes with reliable annotation and testing.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10. Do you prefer working alone or in a team?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I prefer a healthy balance: I enjoy teamwork for brainstorming, peer review, and project alignment, and I value independent time for focused work that requires attention to detail. Flexibility is key depending on project needs.</p>

        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>14. What steps do you take to meet deadlines?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I estimate effort, set milestones, keep a daily to-do, and communicate progress with stakeholders. If scope risks missing a deadline, I propose trade-offs or escalate early so the team can make an informed decision.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>15. How do you prioritize tasks?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I use impact vs. effort — prioritize high-impact, low-effort items first. I maintain a prioritized list, sync with my manager to ensure alignment, and re-prioritize when business needs change.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>16. Have you ever disagreed with a supervisor? How did you handle it?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes. I respectfully presented data and rationale for my perspective, listened to their concerns, and looked for a compromise. Ultimately, I followed the final decision while documenting learnings and monitoring results to revisit if necessary.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>17. How do you handle repetitive tasks?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I create checklists, look for opportunities to automate or batch work, and rotate small responsibilities when possible to avoid fatigue. Regular breaks and micro-goals help maintain accuracy over long runs of repetitive tasks.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>18. What did you learn from your previous job?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I deepened my attention to edge cases in data, learned to write clear guidelines for annotators, and improved cross-team communication to resolve ambiguous items faster. I also gained experience with QC metrics and escalation processes.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>

      <h2>Section 3: Communication Skills</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>21. How do you explain complex tasks to a new colleague?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I break tasks into simple steps, use examples and visuals where possible, and check understanding by asking them to summarize. I provide written references and remain available for follow-up questions until they’re comfortable.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>22. How do you handle a difficult client/customer?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I listen actively to their concerns, validate their feelings, and then provide clear options to resolve the issue. If needed, I escalate with all the relevant context so the client feels heard and the problem gets a timely solution.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>23. What if a teammate doesn’t listen to your instructions?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I ask a clarifying question to ensure my message was clear, provide the necessary context or documentation, and escalate to a manager only if repeated attempts fail. I try to keep communication factual and non-confrontational.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>24. How do you ensure clarity in communication?</summary>

      <details>
        <summary>26. How do you handle language barriers?</summary>
        <div class="answer">

      <details>
        <summary>29. What communication tools have you used?</summary>

        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>30. How do you avoid misunderstandings at work?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I restate key points, summarize action items at the end of meetings, and document decisions in a shared place so everyone can reference them later. This reduces repeated work and ambiguity.</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>I rely on clear guidelines, use keyword spotting as a first filter, and consider context surrounding content. When in doubt, I escalate to a senior reviewer or follow a defined escalation flow.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>35. How do you handle borderline cases in moderation?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>For borderline cases, I consult the guideline examples, check past decisions, and if still unsure, flag for senior review with a short rationale. Documenting the rationale helps refine future guidelines.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>36. What do you do if you’re unsure about content?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I mark the item for escalation, provide context notes for the reviewer, and avoid guessing. Clear escalation paths keep decisions consistent and auditable.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>37. How do you stay unbiased during moderation?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I strictly follow guidelines, avoid personal opinions, and treat similar content consistently. Regular calibration sessions and peer reviews also help remove subjective bias.</p>
        </div>

      <details>
        <summary>38. How do you ensure accuracy?</summary>
        <div class="answer">

        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>39. What tools/platforms have you used for moderation?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I’ve used Labelbox for annotation, internal moderation dashboards, spreadsheets for tracking, and ticketing tools for escalations. Familiarity with these tools speeds onboarding on new projects.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>When two teammates disagreed on a labeling decision, I organized a quick meeting to review examples, referred to guidelines, and guided us to a compromise. We documented the final rule and avoided similar conflicts later.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>42. Tell me about a mistake you made and what you learned.</summary>
        <div class="answer">

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>44. Have you ever gone beyond your responsibilities?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes — I created training snippets for new annotators and ran voluntary calibration sessions that improved quality for the entire team. Leadership appreciated the initiative and it was adopted broadly.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>47. How do you react to negative feedback?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I treat it as actionable data — I ask clarifying questions, implement improvements, and follow up to show progress. This approach turns criticism into opportunity for growth.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>48. What would you do if your teammate was underperforming?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I’d have a private conversation to understand root causes, offer help, suggest training or process changes, and if needed escalate to management with documented observations and proposed support steps.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>49. How do you manage stress during peak work hours?</summary>
